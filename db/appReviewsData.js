But NOW, its becoming dangerous. Not only are her Snaps deleted seconds after viewing, which means I never know what shes talking about, it also sends kids the message that when something is deleted, its gone. My daughter is 13. She doesnt understand quite yet to a full extent that just because her Snap is "gone", it is still in the Cloud and it will be there forever. The horrific SnapMap offers the opportunity to send your location to anyone. WTF!!! Snapchat being one of the least secure social media apps, SnapMap could easily be hacked by someone in their basement, and kids could be kidnapped. I recently checked my daughters Snapchat to see if I could find any evidence as to what she was always talking about locked up in her room. I was horrified. She had received nudes from at least three different guys whod just searched her up and sent (no request and approve system), was in conversation with an adult woman (fairly innocent convo about college, but still), and, in her Unread folder, a video of her best friend twerking on a table in her bra and underwear, and yet another guy from her school smoking weed. I had no idea ANY of this was going on. But with Ghost Mode, my daughter doesnt even have to get notifications as to who is messaging her, and can talk to anyone without history of it. Its like the people who made this app ARE irresponsible teenagers. I am deleting this app from my daughters phone and telling every mom I know about its horrors.',  'alert': true, 'UserId': '1', 'ListedAppId': '1'},

'comments': 'SNAPCHAT REVIEW! When we noticed that our daughter was becoming active online and getting more of an attitude with everyone we started looking into her activity online and I have to say that I am so glad we did. She was cursing, getting sexual post tags from her 11 year old friends, saying sexual things to teenage YouTube heart throbs which she was instructed by them to do via a request to the masses of obsessed girls (she didn’t know it but it was really bad) …. The list goes on, she wasnt doing drugs or getting sexual thankfully but it was a path that she could go down. So we intervened and we continue to do so. I am not saying we examine every single post or message but a glance here and there doesn’t hurt and in our case it was a wakeup call.',

When he clicked the thumbnail the photos were automatically downloaded to his device. He told a friend that he was chatting with at that time, of the harassment and that some idiot had just sent him disgusting pictures. The friend asked to see them and he sent them via text message then promptly deleted them. When the police were called for the harassment issues which included threats of rape and battery, they found the deleted photos and arrested my son, who was in fact the victim of threats and sexual harassment! Please, Please parents no matter how safe you think you are pedophiles can find a way in and KIK is a wide open door! Do Not let them download it. Its not worth the risk!',

'comments': 'A year of Wishbone and I regret it (18 yr old perspective) CSM is lying to you. I need to set some things straight here.  1. Wishbone is a social app, and you can post and message anybody as long as there is a mutual folowing 2. There are a TON of porn accounts 3. There are a TON of bullies 4. There are a TON of catfishes ~Details~ So I have had this app for a year and I regret it so much. I accumulated a following of about 15k people (Man, I was dumb) and I have had my fair share of everything. People say the worst thing about this app is comparing celebrities to each other but I had had about five cyberbullies cuss me out (f***k, s***t, b****h, the whole set). I have also had about ten seven year old girls tell me I was hot and attempted to send me pictures. Even worse, a bunch of people tried to take pictures of me that I posted and use it to get their own gaggle of fangirls. One time a crazy girl even found out my last name even though I never released it. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD GET THIS APP, PLEASE. I REGRET IT, AND YOU WILL REGRET IT. The only nice thing I can think of about this app is that some kindred spirits will defend you through all of this should you choose to socialize with some accounts.',

I thought it was just an innocent app where you can lip-synch and make music videos. She does not have access to the Internet on her iPod, so I figured it couldnt be that bad. About a week later I took a look at what she had done, and there were some music videos that had inappropriate language in them. After watching a lot of other videos that were on there by others, the majority of them were inappropriate and had suggestive language and dancing. On top of that, I realized that even without Internet access, anybody in the community could view her videos, and she could view theirs. There is a setting to set it up that only her friends could view her videos, but it still really bothered me.',
