But NOW, its becoming dangerous. Not only are her Snaps deleted seconds after viewing, which means I never know what shes talking about, it also sends kids the message that when something is deleted, its gone. My daughter is 13. She doesnt understand quite yet to a full extent that just because her Snap is "gone", it is still in the Cloud and it will be there forever. The horrific SnapMap offers the opportunity to send your location to anyone. WTF!!! Snapchat being one of the least secure social media apps, SnapMap could easily be hacked by someone in their basement, and kids could be kidnapped. I recently checked my daughters Snapchat to see if I could find any evidence as to what she was always talking about locked up in her room. I was horrified. She had received nudes from at least three different guys whod just searched her up and sent (no request and approve system), was in conversation with an adult woman (fairly innocent convo about college, but still), and, in her Unread folder, a video of her best friend twerking on a table in her bra and underwear, and yet another guy from her school smoking weed. I had no idea ANY of this was going on. But with Ghost Mode, my daughter doesnt even have to get notifications as to who is messaging her, and can talk to anyone without history of it. Its like the people who made this app ARE irresponsible teenagers. I am deleting this app from my daughters phone and telling every mom I know about its horrors.',  'alert': true, 'UserId': '1', 'ListedAppId': '1'}
